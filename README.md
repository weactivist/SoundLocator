# üéß SoundLocator
SoundLocator is a stereo sound-reactive LED controller powered by FastAPI and running on a Raspberry Pi. It captures audio from a connected PC and visualizes it in real time using a WS2812B LED strip making it ideal for hearing impaired gamers or if you'd like some cool visual audio effects. The system includes a web-based UI and API for controlling brightness, color schemes, and behavior presets.

## üì¶ Prerequisites
- Raspberry Pi with Raspberry Pi OS installed.
- Addressable RGB LED strip like WS2812B 5V DC.
- LED strip wired to Raspberry Pi.
- USB sound card with 3.5mm analog audio input.
- 3.5mm male-to-male stereo audio cable

## üîå LED strip wiring
Your LED strip has at least three wires (sometimes five, if duplicated):

- GND (usually white or black)
- 5V (usually red)
- DIN (data input, usually green)

| LED Strip Wire | Connects To (Raspberry Pi Pin) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| GND | Pin 6 (or any GND) | Must be a shared ground with Pi |
| 5V | Pin 2 or 4 (5V) | OK for low-brightness use (‚â§ ~10%) |
| DIN | Pin 12 (GPIO18) | Use a 330Œ© resistor in line to reduce signal noise |

## üßë‚Äçüíª Setup
1. SSH to your Raspberry Pi.
2. Install Git (if not already)
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git build-essential libffi-dev python3-dev libportaudio2 libopenblas0
```
3. Clone GitHub repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/weactivist/soundlocator.git
cd soundlocator
```
4. Install Poetry
```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

5. Install dependencies
```bash
poetry run pip install RPi.GPIO numpy
poetry install --with rpi
sudo /home/pi/.local/bin/poetry add adafruit-circuitpython-neopixel rpi-ws281x
sudo /home/pi/.local/bin/poetry run pip install RPi.GPIO
```
6. Edit config (available settings can be found in `config/config.py`)
```bash
nano config/config.json
```
Example:
```json
{
    "num_leds": 72,  # Set to the number of LEDs on your strip
    "brightness": 0.1, # Default brightness is 10%
    "max_brightness": 0.1, # Warning: Calculate how many LEDs you can drive. Setting this too high can cause issues with your hardware.
    "color_scheme": "default", # Set color scheme
    "use_simulator": false # Use hardware LED strip
}
```
7. Copy system files
```bash
sudo cp systemd/led-runner.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo cp systemd/soundlocator-api.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo cp systemd/sound-processor.service /etc/systemd/system/
```

8. Reload systemd and enable services
```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable led-runner.service
sudo systemctl enable soundlocator-api.service
sudo systemctl enable sound-processor.service
```

9. Start services (API docs available at: http://<ip_address>:8000/docs)
```
sudo systemctl start led-runner.service
sudo systemctl start soundlocator-api.service
sudo systemctl start sound-processor.service
```

10. Restart services
```
sudo systemctl restart led-runner.service
sudo systemctl restart soundlocator-api.service
sudo systemctl restart sound-processor.service
```

## üßë‚Äçüíª To pull future updates
```
git pull
poetry install --with rpi
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Development
Add `"use_simulator": true` to `config/config.json` to simulate the LEDs in a terminal window.

Start the app: `poetry run uvicorn main:app --reload`

### Build frontend
